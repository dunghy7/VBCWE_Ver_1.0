For the purposes of this tool, we will not be prescriptive about the definition of leadership. You will need to use your judgement to determine who the leaders in your organisation are. To progress gender equality, leaders need to be active advocates and role models for gender equality.

membership.gears.page05.subject=Gender composition of the workforce
membership.gears.page05.description=Gender-balanced organisations tend to have greater levels of employee engagement and retention and have the potential to perform better than organisations that are dominated by one gender.

membership.gears.page06.description=This focus area relates to equitable access to flexible ways of working, including support for employees with caring responsibilities in order to enhance talent attraction and retention, employee engagement and productivity. Flexible working enables an individualised employee experience that considers individual and organisational needs, focussed on high performance. Caring commitments include caring for children, elderly people or people living with a disability – these are increasingly common within diverse workplaces.

membership.gears.page06.question11=Does your organisation have a personal development program in place for parents (i.e. coaching for parents returning to work from parental leave and parenting workshops)?

membership.gears.page07.subject=Preventing and addressing gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying, domestic and family violence
membership.gears.page07.description=Gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace have significant negative impacts on people and organisations. They can reduce employee well-being, job satisfaction, commitment and productivity, increase absenteeism and employee turnover and negatively affect workplace culture. Employers can also be held legally responsible for acts of sexual harassment committed by their employees or agents. Domestic violence is another critical issue that can result in similar effects despite there being an element of behaviour that might be outside of the workplace and/or the person using violence not being an employee of your organisation. The way an organisation educates workers on their rights and obligations regarding gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying, and domestic and family violence is important. The aim should be to eliminate these problems in the workplace and promote an inclusive culture through behaviours reinforced by education and training, and the provision of support where needed.

membership.gears.page07.question05.select01=Confidential grievance procedures
membership.gears.page07.question05.select02=Resolution procedures
membership.gears.page07.question05.select03=Accountability measures
membership.gears.page07.question05.select04=Non-retaliation mechanisms
membership.gears.page07.question06=Are all leaders accountable for ensuring their employees complete gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying training in accordance with policies?
membership.gears.page07.question07=Has your organisation analysed information based on concerns expressed by employees (gathered from consultations, survey, etc.) about gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace?
membership.gears.page07.question08=Does your survey, focus group and other consultation data confirm that employees perceive the gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying policies and practices to be accessible and effective?

membership.gears.page07.question10=Does your organisation’s workplace policies provide guidance on addressing the behaviour of employees who are perpetrators of domestic and family violence?


membership.gears.page08.subject=Professional development, mentoring, sponsorship
membership.gears.page08.description=Professional development, including networking, mentoring and sponsoring are all important to promote gender balance in an organisation.

membership.gears.page08.question08=Are mentoring, coaching and sponsorship practice included as key expectations of your leaders and are they rewarded for the outcomes of these practices?

membership.gears.page09.subject=Recruitment, selection and promotion
membership.gears.page09.description=Gender-balanced recruitment, selection and promotion play a key part of workplace gender equality and inclusion. Robust data analysis and rigorous practice in this area can help to identify and interrupt biases that may compromise gender-balanced outcomes.

membership.gears.page09.question10=Does the organization clearly and openly communicate its promotion process and criteria to employees of all levels?
membership.gears.page09.question11=Does your organisation use recruitment methods that attract talent from diverse backgrounds?
membership.gears.page09.question12=Does your organisation’s leadership actively and openly model, promote and encourage recruitment and promotion from diverse talent pools?

membership.gears.page10.subject=Talent management and succession planning
membership.gears.page10.description=A robust pipeline to leadership involves identifying, attracting, developing, fully utilising and retaining gender-balanced talent at all levels. This pipeline operates across the employee life cycle, from graduate or other entry points to senior leadership opportunities.

freemember.index.page02.subject=Mainstreaming flexible work for performance and support
freemember.index.page02.description=This focus area relates to equitable access to flexible ways of working, including support for employees with caring responsibilities in order to enhance talent attraction and retention, employee engagement and productivity. Flexible working enables an individualised employee experience that considers individual and organisational needs, focussed on high performance. Caring commitments include caring for children, elderly people or people living with a disability – these are increasingly common within diverse workplaces. All organisations must ensure that, as a minimum, they are compliant with local laws that provide for some employees to request flexible ways of working in certain circumstances.
freemember.index.page02.question01=Does your organisation have a flexible working policy and/or strategy?
freemember.index.page02.question02=Does your organisation fulfil the legal requirements in regard to family and caring support (e.g. maternity leave, paternity leave, parental leave)?

freemember.index.page02.question04=Does your organisation provide breastfeeding facilities, other caring support services such as on-site childcare or offer subsidies for childcare?
freemember.index.page02.question05=Does your organisation consult with employees or conduct employee surveys to determine if they believe they have access to the flexibility they need?
freemember.index.page02.question06=Do women and men leaders visibly promote and actively use flexible ways of working at your organisation?

freemember.index.page02.question09=Does your organization communicate policies related to family and caring support to all employees and notifies employees of any changes?
freemember.index.page02.question10=Is flexible work mainstreamed within your organisation, with acknowledgement that outputs and results are valued rather than visibility at the workplace?
freemember.index.page02.question11=Does your organisation have a personal development program in place for parents (i.e. coaching for parents returning to work from parental leave and parenting workshops)?

freemember.index.page03.subject=Preventing and addressing gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying, domestic and family violence
freemember.index.page03.description=Gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace have significant negative impacts on people and organisations. They can reduce employee well-being, job satisfaction, commitment and productivity, increase absenteeism and employee turnover and negatively affect workplace culture. Employers can also be held legally responsible for acts of sexual harassment committed by their employees or agents. Domestic violence is another critical issue that can result in similar effects despite there being an element of behaviour that might be outside of the workplace and/or the person using violence not being an employee of your organisation. The way an organisation educates workers on their rights and obligations regarding gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying, and domestic and family violence is important. The aim should be to eliminate these problems in the workplace and promote an inclusive culture through behaviours reinforced by education and training, and the provision of support where needed.
freemember.index.page03.question01=Does your organisation have a policy and/or strategy on gender-based harassment and discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying, with a formal grievance process in place?
freemember.index.page03.question02=Does your organisation have a policy or strategy to support employees who are experiencing family or domestic violence?
